HQS DQBF solver
---------------

To get help, call
    ./hqs --help

To solve a formula, call HQS with
    ./hqs <filename>
where <filename> is the name of the input file in DQDIMACS
format.

To solve a formula and compute in case it is satisfied a Skolem
function use
    ./hqs --skolem=<outfile.aag> <filename>
<outfile.aag> is the name of the file in which the Skolem functions
should be stored. They are represented as a group of (shared) AIGs.
The file format is the binary AIGER format.

If you want to optimize the size of the Skolem functions, add one or
both of the following parameters:
    --skolem-interpol=1
    --skolem-factor=1
    --abc=<path_to_abc>
The first command applies don't care minimization using interpolation,
the second one tries to factor out a function which is independent of
the currently considered variable (often does not have a strong effect).
The third command uses the tool ABC (https://bitbucket.org/alanmi/abc)
to get smaller AIGs. Here, <path_to_abc> is the path to the ABC binary.


proof_checker
-------------

The proof_checker binary allows to verify the correctness of the
computed Skolem functions. Call it with

./proof_checker <formula> <Skolem>

<formula> is the file (in DQDIMACS format) of the DQBF formula,
<Skolem> the file (in binary AIGER format) of the computed Skolem functions.

It first checks whether the syntactic support each Skolem function
is contained in the variable's dependency set. In a second step it
checks whether replacing all existential variables with their Skolem
function turns the formula into a tautology.
