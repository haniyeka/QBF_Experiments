--reorder               Indicates whether variables should be reordered inside a \n\
                        quantifier. Can sometimes be useful for random QBF.      \n\
\n\
--variable_elimination  Indicates whether variable elimination through unit      \n\
                        propagation should be applied. Can sometimes reduce the  \n\

--deduplication         Indicates whether clauses that are generated multiple    \n\

                        lead to a reduced strain on the internally used sat      \n\
                        solver, but can also result in a signifficant increase   \n\

--dependencies          Indicates whether dependencies provided by DepQBF should \n\
