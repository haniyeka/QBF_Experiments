Version 1.3 (released 2017-09-11)
---------------------------------

- Improved gate handling:
  * Gates are maintained by the preprocessor in a dedicated data structure (hqspre::GateInfo)
  * Syntactic detection of MUX gates, including support for substitution and rewriting of MUX gates.
  * Semantic gate detection using SAT calls (we use Picosat by Armin Biere for that as it is one
    of the very few SAT solvers which support UNSAT core computation). Substitution of semantic
    gates is supported, but not yet rewriting.
- A few bug fixes, clean-up of the code; interface unified.
- Using easylogging++ as logging library
- Added a very simple QBF solver as a wrapper around HQSpre, which
  iterates preprocessing, universal expansion and resolution.
